			<h1>About</h1>

				<a href="http://www.cns.iisc.ac.in/home/people/sridharan-devarajan/" target="_blank"> Dr. Sridharan Devarajan </a>. My research focuses on studying how sensory information is integrated into the hippocampus spatial map. I use a combination of techniques including tetrode recording and computational modeling to understand contextual olfactory information processing in the brain. <br/><br/>
