			<p> At Dr. Sachin's lab, I study how sensory information is integrated into the hippocampus spatial map.
				Hippocampus is involved in the formation of episodic memories. Place cells in the hippocampus suggest that hippocampus forms the spatial framework over which association between items and experiences are overlaid. Rodents are known to rely on olfaction to locate food sources and to navigate in space. I study how olfactory information would be integrated into the hippocampal spatial map in rats during navigation.<br/><br/>
				For this I perform tetrode recordings from the hippocampal complex and the olfactory bulb as the rat forages in a familiar environment and study single/multi-unit activity as well as local field potentials from these regions. Currently I am working on theta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus and olfactory regions and investigating how respiration rhythms modulate gamma oscillations in the olfactory bulb.

				<p> I play football or paint on different surfaces when I am free. If you prefer hand painted tshirts over the regular, I can make for you too.
