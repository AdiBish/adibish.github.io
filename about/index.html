			<p> At Dr. Sachin's lab, I study how sensory information is integrated into the hippocampus spatial map.
				Hippocampus is involved in the formation of episodic memories. Place cells in the hippocampus suggest that hippocampus forms the spatial framework over which association between items and experiences are overlaid. I study how sensory information would be integrated into the hippocampal spatial map in rats during navigation.<br/><br/>
				For this I perform tetrode recordings from the hippocampal complex and the olfactory bulb as the rat forages in a familiar environment and study single/multi-unit activity as well as local field potentials from these regions.
