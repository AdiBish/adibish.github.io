## Using ImageJ(Fiji) to track tetrodes post histology

The [TrakEM2](https://imagej.net/TrakEM2) plugin in [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) allows stacking individual images and aligning them manually. [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) includes all the necessary plugins for TrakEM2. 
There are java based algorithms which require you to mark segments to be used as reference points for automatic image alignment but i have never tried them. I prefer manual alignment over automatic as it gives me more confidence over tracks belonging to tetrodes rather than to drained blood capillaries or damages to the brain section while loading. 

For manual alignment of images, this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p0Jg0QKF24) can be used as a quick tutorial.
