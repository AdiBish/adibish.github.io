## Using ImageJ(Fiji) to track tetrodes post histology

The TrackEM plugin in ImageJ allows stacking individual images and aligning them manually. 
There are java based algorithms which require you to mark segments to be used as reference points for automatic image alignment but i have never tried them. I prefer manual alignment over automatic as it gives me better confidence over tracks belonging to tetrodes rather than blood capillaries or damages to the brain section while loading (?). 

For manual alignment of images, this link can be used as a quick tutorial.

once all the sections have been aligned. 








Some known issues and my work arounds: 
## stacked images do not get loaded in the correct order 

## unable to draw more than 1 lines / curves.
